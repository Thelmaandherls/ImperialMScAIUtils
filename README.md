# ImperialMScAIUtils
A repo containing useful things for the MSc AI course at Imperial. Please feel free to add to this repo any links/code/books you have found useful while on the course.

## Contents:
**[Cheatsheets](cheatsheets/)** --> git, conda, pandas, regex and more!  
**[Books](books/)** --> Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach, Geometric Deep Learning, Graph Representation Learning, Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Dive into Deep Learning,  Mathematics for Machine Learning.  
**[HPC GPU Submission Scripts](gpu_sub_scripts/)** --> Gpucluster, High performance cluster  
**[Pratical Imperial Guides](practical_icl_guides/)** --> Intro to the HPC  
**[Other Useful Scripts](other_useful_scripts/)** --> wandb sweep example yaml file
